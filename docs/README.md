## Supplementary material

These are additional material for the tests performed in the core paper.

### CISVIEW_Collombet.pdf

This is the file where information and analysis of TF bindings in the Collombet dataset [Collombet et al., 2017] extracted from the CisView database [Sharov et al., 2006] is gathered. 

### collombet_crms_cisview.R 

This is the R file used to expand the Collombet model in the algorithm.

### CISVIEW_Dunn.pdf 

This is the file where information and analysis of TF bindings in the Dunn dataset [Dunn et al., 2014] extracted from the CisView database [Sharov et al., 2006] is gathered.

### dunn_crms_cisview.R

This is the R file used to expand the Dunn model in the algorithm.

### "collombet" and "dunn" folders

Contains the first solution models for (resp. non) expanded models (Collombet et al.'s and Dunn et al.'s): resulting (simplified) GRFs and selected interactions in the abstract model, associated with the figures presented at the end of Appendix in the core paper.
